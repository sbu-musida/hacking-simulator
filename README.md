# Hacking Simulation Display

A visually interactive hacking simulation display built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project mimics a hacker terminal with realistic visual effects, such as random code, scrolling text, and simulated progress bars, to create an immersive experience.

## Features

- Real-time simulated terminal interface
- Random generation of system commands and code
- Animated progress bars to simulate hacking tasks (e.g., brute force, data decryption)
- Customizable speed and difficulty settings
- Colorful text effects to mimic a real hacker environment
- Optional background music or sound effects (customizable)

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The simulation will automatically start and display a hacker terminal interface.
3. Watch as random code appears, commands execute, and progress bars fill to simulate the hacking process.
4. You can customize the simulation by adjusting the settings, such as the speed of the terminal output or the type of task being simulated.
5. The simulation includes visual effects to enhance the "hacking" feel, such as code scrambling, red warnings, and green scrolling text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- No installation required. Just open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start the simulation.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the hacking simulation interface.
- `style.css`: The styling file to create a hacker-themed visual environment.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for simulating terminal commands, random code generation, and progress bars.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by adding new features or improving the user interface. Pull requests are welcome.
